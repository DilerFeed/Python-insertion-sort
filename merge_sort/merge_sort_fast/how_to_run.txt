How to use:
1) Copy all files into one folder (you don't have to copy the .pyx file).
2) Run the merge_sort_fast.py file.

If you want to edit the code, then:
1) Download the merge_sort_light.pyx file. Modify its contents (be aware that the Cython language is used).
2) Compile the code for this file using Cython or Cythonbuild.
3) If the file name has been changed, change it in the call in the merge_sort_fast.py file.
